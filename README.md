üìù Overview
This project is an AI-powered research assistant tool built for YouTubers who create niche, topic-driven content. It automates the research and scriptwriting process by scraping, processing, and organizing information based on a selected topic. Users can choose a niche (e.g., gangs, warfare, historical events), input a specific angle (e.g., ‚ÄúLatin Kings in Chicago‚Äù), and receive a structured, original video script suited to their content format (short, medium, or long form).

The tool supports additional user input for context customization and generates ready-to-use scripts with optional visual suggestions, titles, and segment breakdowns. The goal is to help creators streamline research-heavy storytelling with high-quality, AI-assisted scripts.

This project is being developed by two senior computer science students as a personal innovation initiative, aimed at showcasing full-stack development, AI integration, and creator-first product thinking. It‚Äôs designed to function as both a portfolio piece and a potentially scalable product.
